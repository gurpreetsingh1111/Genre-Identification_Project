# Genre-Identification
Identifying what genre a particular song belongs to has been a cakewalk for humans. Can I train the machines to do this job for us? With this motivation in mind, I used Machine Learning as a tool for implementing this task of genre identification. In this project, I have explored methods for exploratory data analysis, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and eventual implementation of several algorithms for classification.

All our codes for the random forest classifier, PCA and the Bayesian optimization can be found in the **code** subdirectory. The results of PCA have been stored in the **images** subdirectory. In the **research** subdirectory, you may find the Stanford paper we referred to in the course of our project.
